## Overview
yes here they are it is finally time for me to reinstall arch every month and put the files here so i dont lose them

I'm using [i3-gaps](https://github.com/Airblader/i3) as a WM and [KDE Plasma](https://www.kde.org/plasma-desktop) as a DE if I'm too stupid to figure out how to do something without a GUI. 

Other things I also use are:
+ Bar: [i3-status](https://github.com/i3/i3status) or [polybar](https://github.com/jaagr/polybar)
+ Application Menu: [rofi](https://github.com/DaveDavenport/rofi)
+ Terminal: [terminator](https://gnometerminator.blogspot.com/p/introduction.html)
+ Browser: [firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/)
+ File Manager: [ranger](https://github.com/ranger/ranger) or [thunar](https://docs.xfce.org/xfce/thunar/start)

## Rice
this is the important part of the whole thing
+ Colour Palette: [arc-dark](https://github.com/horst3180/Arc-theme) and [dracula](https://github.com/dracula/dracula-theme)
+ Cursor: [capitaine-cursors](https://github.com/keeferrourke/capitaine-cursors)
+ Fonts: [muli](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Muli) and [dina](https://www.dcmembers.com/jibsen/download/61/)
